## Installation

```
pip install wagtail-admin-list-controls
```

and add `'admin_list_controls'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings.


## Basic usage

The following example provides two text inputs that allow the user to perform different queries against
the `name` fields on two different models.

```python
# For below Wagtail 6
from wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
# For Wagtail 6 and above
from wagtail_modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register

from admin_list_controls.views import ListControlsIndexView
from admin_list_controls.components import Button, Panel, Columns
from admin_list_controls.actions import SubmitForm
from admin_list_controls.filters import TextFilter


class IndexView(ListControlsIndexView):
        def build_list_controls(self):
            return [
                Panel()(
                    Columns()(
                        TextFilter(
                            name="product_name",
                            label="Product name",
                            apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, value: queryset.filter(name__icontains=value)
                        ),
                        TextFilter(
                            name="creators_name",
                            label="Creator's name",
                            apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, value: queryset.filter(created_by__name__icontains=value)
                        ),
                    ),
                    Button(action=SubmitForm())(
                        "Apply filters",
                    ),
                ),
            ]


@modeladmin_register
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
    index_view_class = IndexView
    # ...
```

The code above should give you a UI that looks like

## Documentation


### Views

To use this lib, you'll want to override the index view on your `ModelAdmin` instance. To do this,
it's recommended to subclass `admin_list_controls.views.ListControlsIndexView`. If you already have
a custom index view defined, you can use `admin_list_controls.views.ListControlsIndexViewMixin`.

To define the controls used for the UI, define the `build_list_controls` method on your index view and
return them in a list.

If you want to effect the queryset based on multiple controls, you can use the `apply_list_controls_to_queryset`
method.


### Components

Components are the basic building blocks of the UI. They are invoked with options, and a second call is used
to define their children. For example:

```python
# Render multiple components nested within other components
from admin_list_controls.components import Block, Icon, Text, Button

Block(style={'color': 'blue'})(
    'This is some blue text before a button',
    Button()(
        Icon('icon icon-plus'),
        'Click me!',
    ),
    Text('This is some pink text after a button', style={'color': 'pink'}),
)
```

All components share some options:
 - `extra_classes`: a string of classnames to add to the component. For example, `'some_class and_another_class'`.
 - `style`: a dictionary of inline styles that are applied to the component. For example, `{'color': 'red'}`.

#### Block

Blocks are analogous to HTML divs. They are block elements that are mostly useful for tweaking the UI in small ways.

```python
# Render a block element with a custom classname that uses floats to move content right.
from admin_list_controls.components import Block

Block(extra_classes='custom_class', style={'float': 'right'})(
    # Child components ...
)
```


#### Spacer

Spacers are a pre-configured Block component that provides some vertical space. Useful for moving text and buttons further
down the UI.

```python
# Render a block element that uses HTML float styling.
from admin_list_controls.components import Spacer

Spacer()(
    # Child components ...
)
```


#### Columns

Column components divide their child components into two equally-spaced columns. You can use the `column_count`
argument to define how many columns are used.

```python
# Render a block element that uses HTML float styling.
from admin_list_controls.components import Columns

# Two columns of components
Columns()(
    # Child components ...
)

# Three columns of components
Columns(column_count=3)(
    # Child components ...
)
```

#### Divider

Divider are analogous to a HTML hr element. They are used to draw horizontal lines that distinguish between areas
of the UI.

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Divider

Divider()
```


#### Panel

Panels are container components that provide a white background and are best used to house filters or other components
that involve a textual component.

They can be collapsed or expanded by default, by defining the `collapsed` argument.

You can dynamically control the collapsed/expanded state of a panel by using the

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Panel

# An expanded panel
Panel()(
    # Child components ...
)

# A panel collapsed by default, with the ref `my_panel`
Panel(collapsed=True, ref='foo')(
    # Child components ...
)

# A button that will toggle the collapsed/expanded state of the `foo` Panel
from admin_list_controls.components import Button
from admin_list_controls.actions import TogglePanel
Button(action=TogglePanel(ref='foo'))(
    'Click me to open and close the `foo` panel'
)
```

#### Icon

Icon components are used to insert icons, usually from wagtail's built-in icons are from a library such as
`wagtailfontawesome`. They are invoked with a classname argument.

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Icon

Icon('icon icon-plus')
```

#### Text

Text components are used to wrap inline text. You can invoke a `Text` component to define options on it, or
you can define it as a string within another component.

Text can have a `size` argument defined, it defaults to `Text.MEDIUM`. There is also a `Text.LARGE` constant
to display text in a size fit for a heading.

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Block, Text

Text('Some text that will display')
Text('Some large heading text', size=Text.LARGE)

# Text components can also be defined by using a normal string as a child of another component
Block()('Some more text will display')
```

#### Button

Button components are used for adding dynamic behavior to your UI, such as selecting values, submitting forms,
expanding panels, following links, etc.

Buttons accept an `action` argument, which can be an [Action](#actions) instance or a list of Actions.

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Button
from admin_list_controls.actions import SetValue, SubmitForm, Link

Button()('Some basic button with text')

Button(action=[
    SetValue(name='name_of_param', value='value_of_param'),
    SubmitForm(),
])(
    'This button sets a value and then submits the search form'
)

Button(action=Link('https://google.com'))(
    'This button will send the user to Google'
)
```

#### Summary

Summary components are used to summarise the data selected in different filters and selectors.
It renders multiple buttons that can be used to reset specific values or the entire set of form

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Summary

Summary()
```


### Filters

Filters are a mixture of Django's widgets and form fields. They allow you to define a form widget and
then apply the submitted values against the list view's queryset.

All components share some options:
 - `name`: a string representing the name of the GET param used by the filter.
 - `label`: a string representing the label of the filter.
 - `apply_to_queryset`: a function that accepts a two arguments, a queryset and the filter's selected value. If a filter
   has a value, this method will be called. If no value has been submitted and no default has been defined, the function
   will not be called.
 - `default_value`: a default value to use if no value has been submitted.

#### TextFilter

A textual input, comparable to an `<input type="text">`.

```python
from admin_list_controls.filters import TextFilter

TextFilter(
    name='name',
    label='Name',
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, value: queryset.filter(name__icontains=value),
)
```

#### BooleanFilter

A checkbox input.

Note that `apply_to_queryset` is only called if a truthy value has been submitted.

```python
from admin_list_controls.filters import BooleanFilter

BooleanFilter(
    name='is_selected',
    label='Is selected',
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, _: queryset.filter(is_selected=True),
)
```

#### RadioFilter

A radio button choice selector. RadioFilter values cannot be cleared, so you will probably want to specify a default
value with an opt-out choice.

```python
from admin_list_controls.filters import RadioFilter

RadioFilter(
    name='color',
    label='Color',
    default_value='',
    choices=(
        ('', 'Any'),
        ('red', 'Red'),
        ('blue', 'Blue'),
        ('green', 'Green'),
    ),
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, value: queryset.filter(color=value) if value else queryset,
)
```

#### ChoiceFilter

A dropdown choice selector. ChoiceFilters can have their values cleared.

The optional argument `multiple` indicates if the widget should allow multiple values.

```python
from admin_list_controls.filters import ChoiceFilter

# Single choice
ChoiceFilter(
    name='color',
    label='Color',
    choices=(
        ('red', 'Red'),
        ('blue', 'Blue'),
        ('green', 'Green'),
    ),
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, value: queryset.filter(color=value),
)

# Multiple choice
ChoiceFilter(
    name='color',
    label='Color',
    multiple=True,
    choices=(
        ('red', 'Red'),
        ('blue', 'Blue'),
        ('green', 'Green'),
    ),
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset, values: queryset.filter(color__in=values),
)
```

### Selectors

Selectors are buttons that are used to toggle form values and then effect the view. A selector will
apply its effects if its `value` is passed in the GET params.

Selectors accept a boolean value for the `is_default` param. Those with a truthy value will be
selected without any submitted data.


#### SortSelector

SortSelectors are used to switch between different sorting methods on the queryset. SortSelectors use
the `sort` GET param by default, but this can be changed with the `name` argument to the instance.

```python
from admin_list_controls.selectors import SortSelector

# The default sorting method, will be applied if none are selected
SortSelector(
    value='name_sort_asc',
    is_default=True,
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset: queryset.order_by('name')
)(
    'Sort by name A-Z'
)

SortSelector(
    value='name_sort_desc',
    apply_to_queryset=lambda queryset: queryset.order_by('-name')
)(
    'Sort by name Z-A'
)
```


#### LayoutSelector

LayoutSelectors are used to switch between different display styles on the list view's results.
They accept an optional `template` argument which should be a path to a django template.

```python
from admin_list_controls.selectors import LayoutSelector

# The default layout to use
LayoutSelector(
    value='list_view',
    is_default=True,
)(
    'List view'
)

LayoutSelector(
    value='grid_view',
    template='path/to/template.html'
)(
    'Grid view'
)
```


### Actions

Actions are dynamic behaviours that can be added to buttons as the `action` argument. They can be passed as single
action instance, or a list of actions that will be applied sequentially.

```python
from admin_list_controls.components import Button
from admin_list_controls.actions import SubmitForm, SetValue, Link

Button(action=SubmitForm())(
    'Submit the form and reloads the result list'
)

Button(action=[
    SetValue(
        name='some_param',
        value='some_value',
    ),
    SubmitForm()
])(
    'Sets a value and then submits it'
)

Button(action=Link('https://google.com'))(
    'Sends the user to Google'
)
```

#### SetValue

Used to set form values.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import SetValue

SetValue(
    name='some_param',
    value='some_value',
)
```

#### RemoveValue

Used to remove values from the form. If multiple values have been entered for a certain `name`, this
can be used to selectively remove a single value.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import RemoveValue

RemoveValue(
    name='some_param',
    value='some_value',
)
```

#### Link

Used to send the users browser to a certain url.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import Link

Link(url='https://google.com')
```

#### TogglePanel

Used to toggle a panel between collapsed and expanded states. The `ref` argument
should match the `ref` on a Panel declaration.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import TogglePanel

TogglePanel(ref='some_panel_ref')
```

#### CollapsePanel

Used to collapse a panel. The `ref` argument should match the `ref` on a Panel declaration.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import CollapsePanel

CollapsePanel(ref='some_panel_ref')
```

#### ClearSearchInput

Used to clear Wagtail's built-in search input.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import ClearSearchInput

ClearSearchInput()
```

#### SubmitForm

Used to submit the form with any data that has been added to it.

```python
from admin_list_controls.actions import SubmitForm

SubmitForm()
```


## Rationale and goals

This library emerged from a large build that required an admin list view with an exhaustive set of filters and the
ability for users to change the ordering of the results. The filters would need to perform exact and substring matching
against textual fields, as well as exact matches on boolean and choice fields. Some of the sorts applied to order the
results also relied on complicated querying and conditional behaviours. In some extreme conditions, certain
combinations of filters and sorts would require distinct code paths.

We initially attempted to use Wagtail's built-in searching and filtering features, but they were found to be too
limiting for our use-cases and resulted in a non-optimal experience for users. Third-party libraries were
investigated, but the ecosystem doesn't have much covering the space.

Somewhat reluctantly, this library was built to cover our needs. Now that the dust has settled and the code has
stabilised, we're finding increasing numbers of use-cases for it.
